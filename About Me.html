        <P>
            My name is Maurine Chebet. Software developer, graphic designer and technical trainer by proffession.<br>
            I train kids & teens on how to code, be safe online, digital literacy and web development. <br>
            In this digital age, some parents and caregivers navigate the challenges faced by ignoring them.<br> 
            This however presents a temporary solution to a permanent problem. <br>
            For this case, I chip in by training them on ways of solving those challenges.<br>
            I cover various technology related issues that affect our day to day lives with the goals being:
            <ol> 
                <li>Creating awareness on the benefits of technology</li> 
                <li>Elaborating on disasters that can result when technology is misused</li> 
                <li>Online safety</li>
            </ol>
